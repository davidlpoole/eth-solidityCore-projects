# Solidity Core Projects
## Party Split (`party.sol`)
Create a group with your friends to split a shared expense. 
Once the party's over, it's time to pay the shared expenses! 
Be sure to distribute the remainder to the members of the party.





# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy_Lock.js
npx hardhat test --grep "party"
```
